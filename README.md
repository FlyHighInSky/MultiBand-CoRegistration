# MultiSpectral-CoRegistration
Overlays images captured by cameras fixed in a rig, e.g. Parrot Sequoia and RedEdge MicaSense
This is an implementation of the following paper:
Shahbazi, M. and Cortes, C., 2019. Seamless Co-Registration of Images from Multi-Sensor Multispectral Cameras. The International Archives of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, 42, pp.315-322.

## Requirements
The code is written in C++17 and tested only on Windows Visual Studio 2019
Dependencies include Eigen, LAPACK (prebuilt libraries are included in this repo), and OpenCV4.2

## Test Data
A folder including test data from a Sequoia multi-spectral camera is included
